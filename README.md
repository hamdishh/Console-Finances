# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Description
The Console Finances project displays a proficient understanding in using complex javascript language to analyse financial data to be printed in the console.
In order to begin my code a new github repository that i linked in my submission was made on the github website and this repository named Console-Finances was then cloned locally my desktop via the command git clone using the SSH key i had set up prior the starting of the bootcamp.
